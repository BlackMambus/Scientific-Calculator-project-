Scientific Calculator in C++

This project is a console-based scientific calculator developed using C++. It supports a wide range of mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as advanced scientific functions such as:

Trigonometric calculations (sine, cosine, tangent)

Logarithmic and exponential functions

Power and root functions

Factorials

Angle unit conversions (degrees â†” radians)

The program utilizes modular programming with functions for each type of operation, making the code clean, organized, and easy to maintain. Input validation ensures robust user interaction, and the menu-driven interface allows users to select operations with ease.

Built using the C++ Standard Library and math functions from <cmath>, this calculator is an ideal project for beginners looking to sharpen their understanding of mathematical algorithms, function handling, and user interaction in C++.
